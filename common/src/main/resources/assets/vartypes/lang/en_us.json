	"type.vartypes.animal": "Animal",
	"type.vartypes.aduain": "Aduain",
	"type.vartypes.aduain.desc": "Aduain are strange and bizarre creatures, often possessed of physical features or properties that defy natural explanation. No-one is entirely certain where they actually come from, though many are found in the depths, either in the lightless ocean or the deepest darkest caverns. Some unconfirmed reports also describe them living in abundance in the Farthest Realms, and the Fae in particular don't take kindly to them.",
	"type.vartypes.arthropod": "Arthropod",
	"type.vartypes.construct": "Construct",
	"type.vartypes.construct.desc": "Unlike Undead, Constructs are usually made from component materials that were never living to begin with and were made to be animate by magic or other processes. As a result, they are typically extremely durable, though they also often suffer from an inability to restore damage passively. Humans are most familiar with Constructs via the golems that defend Muintir settlements.",
	"type.vartypes.dragon": "Dragon",
	"type.vartypes.element": "Element",
	"type.vartypes.fae": "Fae",
	"type.vartypes.fae.desc": "The Fae are mischievous creatures from the Emerald Fields, a forgotten dimension as ancient as it is unreachable by Human hands. Orkin legend tells that they first arrived in the Overworld when a mythic hero tore open a portal to the Fields with a magic spear. Though their pranks and jokes can give them the appearance of being untrustworthy or even malevolent, they consider themselves mentors and educators to the shorter-lived races.",
	"type.vartypes.human": "Human",
	"type.vartypes.human.desc": "Humans should generally be the most familiar type of creature to Linn, as it describes everything that is roughly Linn-size and bipedal. Humans exist in relative diversity, and a great many forms are distinguished only in minor details. This includes the Muintir, the Naimhde, and even the Orkin.",
	"type.vartypes.ooze": "Ooze",
	"type.vartypes.ooze.desc": "Oozes are primordial creatures that are so old even the Fae don't know when they first appeared in the world. They are simple creatures, quite literally, as they often appear to be a mass of acidic fluid contained only by a semi-porous membrane. Though this leaves them little room for higher thought, they should be approached with caution, as this lack of reasoning has done nothing to hinder their survival for millennia.",
	"type.vartypes.othall": "Othall",
	"type.vartypes.othall.desc": "Othall, literally meaning ''from over there'', describes creatures who usually originate from a dimension other than the Overworld. Though not many in number in the Overworld, owing to their distant homelands, they are often figures of legend, for good or ill.",
