	// Status effects
	"effect.vartypes.fatigue": "Fatigue",
	// Supertypes
	"type.vartypes.animal": "Animal",
	"type.vartypes.animal.desc": "Animals are abundant and diverse creatures, typically possessed of a blissful state of ignorance that fills their days with idle comfort and joy. But when their stomach grows empty, nature often gifts them with the teeth and claws to rival any blade and sunder any armour. Fortunate indeed then that they need only overcome their neighbour, far less often you, to see their belly filled.",
	"type.vartypes.aduain": "Aduain",
	"type.vartypes.aduain.desc": "Aduain are strange and bizarre creatures, often possessed of physical features or properties that defy natural explanation. No-one is entirely certain where they actually come from, though many are found in the depths, either in the lightless ocean or the deepest darkest caverns. Some unconfirmed reports also describe them living in abundance in the Farthest Realms, and the Fae in particular don't take kindly to them.",
	"type.vartypes.arthropod": "Arthropod",
	"type.vartypes.arthropod.desc": "Though the term specifically refers to a group of exoskeletal invertebrates with many legs, in modern parlance it has instead come to mean any animalistic creature that creates an inconvenience for civilised folk. Unlike Animals, they are almost universally carnivorous, and correspondingly hostile even when sated.",
	"type.vartypes.construct": "Construct",
	"type.vartypes.construct.desc": "Unlike Undead, Constructs are usually made from component materials that were never living to begin with and were made to be animate by magic or other processes. As a result, they are typically extremely durable, though they also often suffer from an inability to restore damage passively. Humans are most familiar with Constructs via the golems that defend Muintir settlements.",
	"type.vartypes.dragon": "Dragon",
	"type.vartypes.dragon.desc": "Creatures of ancient legend, Dragons are frequently reptilian in appearance but their might far belies such a comparison. They are physically imposing, magically potent, and often possessed of airs of superiority as a result. However, their inevitable arrogance often contributes mercifully to their scarcity.",
	"type.vartypes.element": "Element",
	"type.vartypes.element.desc": "When discussing the Elements, two facts are crucial: With enough magic anything can be moved, and magic is in everything. Therefore it is only a matter of density that keeps rocks and water alike beholden to gravity. Elements are what happens when that density not only reaches a critical point, but far exceeds it. Though living, they have precious little in common with most other forms of life, and are often energetic and unstable.",
	"type.vartypes.fae": "Fae",
	"type.vartypes.fae.desc": "The Fae are mischievous creatures from the Emerald Fields, a forgotten dimension as ancient as it is unreachable by Human hands. Orkin legend tells that they first arrived in the Overworld when a mythic hero tore open a portal to the Fields with a magic spear. Though their pranks and jokes can give them the appearance of being untrustworthy or even malevolent, they consider themselves mentors and educators to the shorter-lived races.",
	"type.vartypes.human": "Human",
	"type.vartypes.human.desc": "Humans should generally be the most familiar type of creature to Linn, as it describes everything that is roughly Linn-size and bipedal. Humans exist in relative diversity, and a great many forms are distinguished only in minor details. This includes the Muintir, the Naimhde, and even the Orkin.",
	"type.vartypes.ooze": "Ooze",
	"type.vartypes.ooze.desc": "Oozes are primordial creatures that are so old even the Fae don't know when they first appeared in the world. They are simple creatures, quite literally, as they often appear to be a mass of acidic fluid contained only by a semi-porous membrane. Though this leaves them little room for higher thought, they should be approached with caution, as this lack of reasoning has done nothing to hinder their survival for millennia.",
	"type.vartypes.othall": "Othall",
	"type.vartypes.othall.desc": "Othall, literally meaning ''from over there'', describes creatures who usually originate from a dimension other than the Overworld. Though not many in number in the Overworld, owing to their distant homelands, they are often figures of legend, for good or ill.",
	"type.vartypes.plant": "Plant",
	"type.vartypes.plant.desc": "Plants are the abundant greenery of the natural world. In truth they have a great deal in common with most animals, but are generally less mobile and find their nutrients in other ways. This should not be taken as a definitive, however, as some examples are all too willing to resort to more violent methods to feed their roots.",
	"type.vartypes.undead": "Undead",
	"type.vartypes.undead.desc": "Things that die, are dead. Things that are given life, are alive. These are the immutable binary states flouted by the existence of Undead. Whether by curse, alchemy, or crass magicks, they are once-living things caught part-way between the two conditions. This often leaves them hobbled with new vulnerabilities and fewer measures against them, but also affords them greater durability and resilience.",

	"subtype.vartypes.naimhde.desc": "Not all Muintir are benevolent, and some offshoots have become outright hostile",

	"subtype.vartypes.orkin.desc": "Though once native to the Overworld, these porcine peoples have had to learn to survive in far less pleasant realms",

	"subtype.vartypes.verdine": "Verdine",
	// Species
	"species.vartypes.human": "Linn",

	"template.vartypes.reptilian": "Reptilian",
	"template.vartypes.reptilian.desc": "Most often from communities living along the coast or in swamps, these specimens are adept divers with hardy scaled skin",
